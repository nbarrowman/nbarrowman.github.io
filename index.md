## vtree

**vtree** is my R package for calculating and drawing what I call *variable trees*. vtree is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vtree). For more information, see the [GitHub page for vtree](https://github.com/nbarrowman/vtree).

Here's a [recent presentation](https://github.com/nbarrowman/nbarrowman.github.io/blob/master/vtree%20-%20An%20R%20Package%20for%20Calculating%20and%20Drawing%20Variable%20Trees.pptx)
